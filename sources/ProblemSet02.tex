\question Determine which of the following binary operations are associative.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item the operation \(\star\) on \(\Z\) defined by \(a\star b  = a-b\)
    \item the operation \(\star\) on \(\R\) defined by \(a\star b  = a+b+ab\)
    \item the operation \(\star\) on \(\Q\) defined by \(a\star b  = \dfrac{a+b}{5}\)
    \item the operation \(\star\) on \(\Z\times\Z\) defined by \((a , b) \star (c,d)  = (ad+bc, bd)\)
    \item the operation \(\star\) on \(\Q\backslash\left\{ 0 \right\}\) defined by \(a\star b = \dfrac{a}{b} \)
\end{enumerate}

\question
