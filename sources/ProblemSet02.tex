\question 
If \(x\) and \(g\) are elements of the group \(G\), prove that \(|x|=\left|g^{-1} x g\right|\). Deduce that \(|a b|=|b a|\) for all \(a, b \in G\).

\question

\question
Assume \({H}\) is a nonempty subset of \((G, \star)\) which is closed under the binary operation on \(G\) and is closed under inverses, i.e., for all \(h\) and \(k\) elements of \(H\) it holds    \(hk,h^{-1} \in H\). Prove that \(H\) is a group under the operation \(\star\) restricted to \(H\) (such a subset \(H\) is called a subgroup of \(G\) ).

\question
Prove that if \(x\) is an element of the group \(G\) then \(\left\{x^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}\) is a subgroup (cf. the preceding exercise) of \(G\) (called the cyclic subgroup of \(G\) generated by \(x\)).

\question
Let \(\sigma\) be the permutation
