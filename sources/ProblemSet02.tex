The next exercise introduces the Heisenberg group over the field \(F\) and develops some of its basic properties. When \(F=\mathbb{R}\) this group plays an important role in quantum mechanics and signal theory by giving a group theoretic interpretation (due to H. Weyl) of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Note also that the Heisenberg group may be defined more generally for example, with entries in \(\mathbf{Z}\).
