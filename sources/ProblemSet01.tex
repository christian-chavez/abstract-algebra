\question
  For each of the following pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\), determine their greatest common divisor, their least common multiple, and write their greatest common divisor in the form \(a x+b y\) for some integers \(x\) and \(y\).
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \(a=792, b=275\)
    \item \(a=507885, b=60808\)
  \end{enumerate} 

\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(\gcd(a,b) = 11\), \(\lcm(a,b) = 19800\), \(\gcd(a,b)= 8a - 23b\)
        \item \(\gcd(a,b) = 691\), \(\lcm(a,b) = 44693880\), \(\gcd(a,b)= -17a +142b\)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}


\question
    Prove that if \({n}\) is composite then there are integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(n\) divides \(a b\) but \(n\) does not divide either \(a\) or \(b\).

\begin{solution}
    Let \(n\) be composite. By definition we have \(n=a b\) for some integers \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a, b \neq \pm 1, \pm n\). Clearly \(n \mid a b\). Now suppose by way of contradiction that \(n \mid a\). Then we have \(k n=a\) for some integer \(k\). Now \(k b a=a\), so \((k b-1) a=0\), so \(k b=1\). Thus \(b= \pm 1\), a contradiction. Hence,  \(n\) does not divide \(a\). Similarly, \(n\) does not divide \(b\).
\end{solution}

\question
    If \(p\) is a prime prove that there do not exist nonzero integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2=p b^2\) (i.e., \(\sqrt{p}\) is not a rational number).

\question
    Prove that if \(a=a_n 10^n+a_{n-1} 10^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1 10+a_0\) is any positive integer then \(a \equiv a_n+a_{n-1}+\cdots+a_1+a_0(\bmod 9)(\) note that this is the usual arithmetic rule that the remainder after division by 9 is the same as the sum of the decimal digits mod \(9-\) in particular an integer is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9 ) [note that \(10 \equiv 1(\bmod 9)\) ].

\question
    Prove that the equation \(a^2+b^2=3 c^2\) has no solutions in nonzero integers \(a, b\) and \(c\). [Consider the equation mod 4 as in the previous two exercises and show that \(a, b\) and \(c\) would all have to be divisible by 2 . Then each of \(a^2, b^2\) and \(c^2\) has a factor of 4 and by dividing through by 4 show that there would be a smaller set of solutions to the original equation. Iterate to reach a contradiction.]

\question
    Let \(n \in \mathbb{Z}, n>1\), and let \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) with \(1 \leq a \leq n\). Prove if \(a\) and \(n\) are not relatively prime, there exists an integer \(b\) with \(1 \leq b<n\) such that \(a b \equiv 0(\bmod n)\) and deduce that there cannot be an integer \(c\) such that \(a c \equiv 1(\bmod n)\).


\begin{solution}
    
\end{solution}


\question
    Let \(n \in \mathbb{Z}, n>1\), and let \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) with \(1 \leq a \leq n\). Prove that if \(a\) and \(n\) are relatively prime then there is an integer \(c\) such that \(a c \equiv 1(\bmod n)\), [use the fact that the g.c.d. of two integers is a \(\mathbb{Z}\)-linear combination of the integers].

\question
    Conclude from the previous two exercises that \((\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})^{\times}\)is the set of elements \(\bar{a}\) of \(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}\) with \((a, n)=1\) and hence prove Proposition 4 . Verify this directly in the case \(n=12\).

     A Pythagorean triple is a triple \((a, b, c)\) of positive integers for which
\[
